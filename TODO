Development plan
----------------

- Should be able access remote hosts when using TCP/IP communication
- Integrated functionality:
  - Linux users' administration - 20% done
  - IPTables - 90% done
  - expose commands to the socket interface
- Implement 'user:password' based authentication, maybe with base64 encoding
- Configuration spaces:
  - SCMs (i.e. Git and SVN)
    - Implement installation for Git module
    - Implement installation of web-modules -> websvn, gitweb
    - about 90% already done
  - DNS administration (BIND) - 100% done
    - Creation of zone files and zone entries - 100% done
    - Deletion of zone files and zone entries - 100% done
    - Dump of zone files and zone records - 100% done
  - CRON
    - crontab
       - Write as: "Min Hour Day Month DOW /path/to/command" per line and save as crontabFile
       - Apply using crontab [-u user if current user == root] crontabFile
       - List using crontab -l
       - Remove using crontab -r
    - Could be disabled for binaries/cgi scripts by root user (to just support PHP scripts)
  - e-mail like POP3(s)/IMAP(s) - Dovecot - and SMTP (postfix)
    - Implement virtual users creation & deletion
    - Save e-mails to safe place, alter permissions
    - Location should be optional, allow setting location in manager.conf file
  - FTP(s) & SCP
    - Maybe revive the limshell project for those purposes, join with SSL layer and listen on some other port
    - Could be database connected
  - HTTP(s) (httpd.conf + conf.d/*.conf) & PHP (php.ini) configuration
    - Allow both raw php.ini editing and configurable options in select of HTML page (for frontend)
    - Support multiple programming languages - Perl, Python, Ruby On Rails
  - Disk quotes
  - SELinux
  - Databases
    - allow new user creation, user deletion, database creation and deletion, setting permissions per database
    - allow remote access (using different hostname, i.e. not localhost only)
    - mod_db_mysql
    - mod_db_pgsql
    - Get root login information from manager.conf configuration file for administration purposes (available for root shell login only)
  - Backups
